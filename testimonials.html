He is accommodating and flexible and has vast musical knowledge. Being centred in Clacton means his lessons are easily accessible and he has very reasonable rates - great value for money.

            <div class=" test col-md-12"><h4><i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i>     Best guitar lessons I've had!

                Craigs direction really gave me what I needed, I had stagnated and the knowledge he imparted helped me to realise the underlying structure of the music, he has a great eye for what players need to expand their skills at all levels; and is probably the best guitarist I've met. I would recommend his tuition to players of all ages and experience. And I still take regular lessons now.
                VERY IMPRESSED.

            <h1>SKYPE LESSONS</h1>
            <p>Since the Covid-19 pandemic, we've all had to adapt in various aspects of life including how we continue to work and learn. Guitar Lessons via video conferencing apps like skype and zoom
                have seen a huge surge in popularity as a result. They enable high quality instruction to continue on a remote basis which means you can hone your guitar playing skills from anywhere in the world. How cool is that?
            </p> <br>
            <h3 >What equipment do I need to start having skype lessons?</h3>
            <p>All you need is a guitar, a strong internet connection, a webcam with a built in mic and a willingness to learn!
                you could plug a guitar and microphone into an audio interface if you'd prefer but this is by no means a requirement.
            </p> <br>
            <h3>What ages do you teach?</h3>
            <p>There is next to no restriction on age to learn. If you can hold the guitar and have an interest in learning, that's all there is to it!</p> <br>
            <h3>Will I be provided with lesson material at the end such as chord charts, diagrams and tablature?</h3>
            <p>Absolutely! Learning is always supported by material containing the subject of the lesson. This way, you will always have 
                a reference to lesson content during practise time (which is where the real learning happens!) and won't have to rely on memory. This content can be sent in the skype chat
                window as pdf files or emailed to you if you prefer.
            </p> <br>
            <h3>How do we proceed with payment for the lessons?</h3>
            <p>Payment is to be recieved in full for the agreed timeslot no later than 30 minutes before the lesson start time.
               Accepted payment methods include paypal and bank transfer. Cancellations that occur later than 24 hours before the start time may still be subject to charge.

    <div class="container">
        <div class="invisible-container"><h1>ONE ON ONE LESSONS</h1>
         <P>This is the traditional format for lessons. One hour or 30 minutes of face to face guitar instruction in a dedicated home studio. No matter your particular goals, current level, or preferred playing style
            this is where we can delve into great detail on improving your guitar playing ability to guide you towards your goals.
         </P> <br>
         <h3 >What equipment do I need to bring along to lessons?</h3> 
         <p>Typically your guitar, a lead, plectrums and a capo dependng on what we're going to be doing. You can also bring along your own small amplifier if you prefer
             but it's not essential as they are always provided. If you're a beginner and have yet to purchase your own guitar, no problem at all, spare guitars 
             are available to use!
         </p> <br>
         <h3>What hours do you usually teach?</h3>
         <p>Teaching hours are typically between 9am to 6pm monday to saturday. If you want to take lessons and have
             a particular slot in mind, simply get in touch to find out availability!
         </p> <br>
         <h3>What ages do you teach?</h3>
         <p>All ages and abilities are welcome to learn. </p> <br>

    <div class="container">
        <div class="invisible-container"><h1>HOME LESSONS</h1>
            <p>If for whatever reason you would rather learn from your own home, I'm happy to accomodate. The same face to face 
                quality guitar instruction but without having to go anywhere! Travel expenses are reflected in the hourly rate.
            </p> <br>
            <h3>How far do you travel for lessons?</h3>
            <p>For the sake of keeping things cost effective for all, I usually operate on a limit of a 20 mile radius from 
                the clacton-on-sea area. This is negotiable in some cases but will be reflected in the fee.
            </p><br>
            <h3>Do you require anything in particular for home visits?</h3>
            <p>Other than 2 seats and access to a power point, there are no special requirements.</p> <br>


            <h3>What ages do you teach?</h3>
            <p>All ages and abilities are welcome to learn. </p> <br>
